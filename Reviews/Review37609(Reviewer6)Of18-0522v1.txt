The authors propose a method for free-floating space robot to grasp a
non-cooperative tumbling satellite. The grasping strategy is based
onTarget motion prediction, robot motion planning and trajectory
tracking. Due to modelling uncertainties, the tracking controller is
designed to partly adapt the reference trajectory online. The Extended
Kalman Filter is implemented to ensure a Lipschitz continuity of
measurements, which makes the control method robust for executing the
grasping task. Experiment results validated the proposed method.

This paper is well-organized. The work is of novelty. The proposed
grasping strategy is useful for the engineers and scholars in relative
field. This paper can be accepted after minor revision. The following
comments should be considered:
1)The term "Non-cooperative" in the title and the main contents should
be deleted. Since the grasping point is pre-selected and the pose is
measured at each sampling period. The "Non-cooperative" characteristics
are weak.

2) The following papers about the dynamics of space robot and tumbling
target capturing should be refered and campared:
